### How to start Master mining instance using SoliditySHA3Miner

0) Prequisites :

0a) .Net Core Runtime
  * Windows => download and run [https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/thank-you/dotnet-runtime-2.2.2-windows-x64-installer]
  * Ubuntu => run script 'sudo ./install-deps.sh'
  * Ethos => run script 'sudo ./install-deps-ethOS.sh'

0b) Nvidia driver (410, CUDA 10.0 onwards), and/or AMD driver.

1) Clone and rename 0xbtcSolo/PoolMaster.bat/sh file and open the editor for the cloned file.

2) You only need to edit the line that starts with 'dotnet' for launch parameters.

3) Below are the following arguments that may/need to be changed :

3a) allowIntel/AMD/CUDA=
  * Set to true if the main instance is mining as well

3b) networkUpdateInterval=
  * Set the frequency (in miliseconds) to query latest information from the network.
  * If using Infura, too low a value may get rate-limited or a temporary ban.
  * Default value if left empty is 15000.

3c) abiFile=
  * If omitted, the '0xBTC.abi' file will be used by default
  * Most tokens are compatible with '0xBTC.abi', most likely no need to change here
  * Replace the value to the available filename that ends with '.abi' in the folder for the token interface you are mining.

3c) contract=
  * If omitted, 0xBTC contract address will be used by default.
  * Replace the value with the following address if you are mining a different token (case-sensitive):

	0xBTC    0xB6eD7644C69416d67B522e20bC294A9a9B405B31
	LIRA     0x49AAa160506F7e07E6C3F6cD6316b6866025cDcB
	CLM      0xA38FcEdd23dE2191Dc27f9a0240ac170BE0A14fE
	SEDO     0x0F00f1696218EaeFa2D2330Df3D6D1f94813b38f
	PEPE     0xBC2AFc039d2BFa67d582aC181daB5BE17EC91f82
	0xBCH    0xe5b9746dfCC2eF1054D47A451A77bb5f390c468d
	0xCATE   0x8F7DbF90E71285552a687097220E1035C2e87639
	0xLTC    0x33D99EFc0C3cC4F93dA6931EC2CCcF19Ca874b6D
	0xGOLD   0x291DE53a16b76dfE28551Fd3335225F506dB8b82
	ATA      0xd72F60b2E7649bBC5835d25e30Ef917f04D9131c
	KIWI     0x2BF91c18Cd4AE9C2f2858ef9FE518180F7B5096D
	SKO      0xb3Dc3C839a02134f9932CbD60f3566C231cc90CC

  * If the token is not in the list above, I suggest that you might want to ask from the owner/moderator from their relavant Discord/Telegram/forums.

4) If pool mining, below are the following arguments that may/need to be changed : (skip to 5 for solo mining)

4a) pool=
  * If omitted, 'http://mike.rs:8080' will be used as default.
  * Please ask for the pool address:Port from the owner/moderator from their relavant Discord/Telegram/forums.
  * Note that 'http(s)://' is required as a prefix.
  * Pool address:Port might change over time, it is your responsibility to keep updated of the pool status.

4b) address=
  * If omitted, you are donating 100% to the developer.
  * Replace the value with your own mining Ethereum address (42 characters long including '0x' prefix, case-sensitive).

5) If solo mining, ensure that you have sufficient ETH stored in your mining address (ETH is required to mint tokens).
  * Below are the following arguments that may/need to be changed :

5a) gasToMine=
  * If omitted, 5 GWei will be used.
  * Replace the value with the amount of gas you prefer to mint a block with (decimals allowed, no alphabets).
  * This value will override dynamic gas price if this value, whichever is higher.

5b) gasApiURL=
  * Required for dynamic gas price minting
  * If using 'EthGasStation.info', fill the value with https://ethgasstation.info/json/ethgasAPI.json
  
5c) gasApiPath=
  * If using 'EthGasStation.info', fill the value with (without quotes) '$.safeLow'
  
5d) gasApiMultiplier=
  * If using 'EthGasStation.info', fill the value with 0.1
  
5e) gasApiOffset=
  * Depends on how much you want to offset (decimals allowed, no alphabets).
  
5f) privateKey=
  * Replace the value with your own ETH private key (65 characters long excluding '0x' prefix)
  * It is your own responsibility to keep your private ETH account safe.
  * One suggestion is to create a disposable ETH mining account to mine with then transfer the tokens to your private account later.

6) Ensure firewall settings has been set correctly.

7) Save and run the '.bat/sh' file you have newly created, as Administrator/sudo.


### How to start Slave mining instance using SoliditySHA3Miner

0) Prequisites :

0a) .Net Core Runtime
  * Windows => download and run [https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/thank-you/dotnet-runtime-2.2.2-windows-x64-installer]
  * Ubuntu => run script 'sudo ./install-deps.sh'
  * Ethos => run script 'sudo ./install-deps-ethOS.sh'

0b) Nvidia driver, and/or AMD driver.

1 ) Update the following arguments that need to be changed in SoliditySHA3MinerSlave.bat/sh:

1a) masterURL=
  * Replace the URL (http://{IP}:{port}/) with your master instance.

1b) slaveUpdateInterval=
  * Set the frequency (in miliseconds) to query latest information from the master instance.
  * Default value if left empty is 5000.
  
2) Save and run SoliditySHA3MinerSlave.bat/sh.
